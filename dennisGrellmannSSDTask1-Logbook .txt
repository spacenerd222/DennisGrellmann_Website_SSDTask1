23/4
started creating the story board with canva to illustrate and create a viusal idea of what I want it to look like.
Made good progress probably 1/3 of the way through.
It has been pretty easy so far, the hardest parts were just figuring out what I wanted it to look like and the design.
I'm going to try and limit myself from trying to perfect it as it's really just a storyboard and I need to focus on the actual creation of it
It has been pretty good and I'm happy with how I'm going

26/4
Working on the story board, finalizing the structure of how everything is going to interact. 
Almost finished just need to clean the folder up and name everything correctly.
I tried mapping everything in photoshop but it was inefficient so I did a quick google search and found an online tool to map everything easier and quicker.
I will start the html and work efficiently so I don't get overwhelmed.
The pace is good and I'm happy with the amount of progress I'm doing everyday

27/4
Finished the storyboard completely. The maps and folder are all organised and done. I started with the Html and Css for the home/main page. I refered to my old 
projects keeping the feedback I received. I got about 2/3 done of the home page.
One of the blocks I encountered were the positioning and how to do it. Previously I had used several different methods together that didn`t yield the results I wanted 
so I went back and studied how the positioning works and what I should be using. 
Draw.io was very easy to use and saved me a lot of time and gave me satisfaction with how it turned out. 
The pace is going great and I am confident it will turn out how I want it.

11/5
I started again working on the homepage. I got most of the CSS done. I impletemented a back up button and made it static so it follows you while you scroll down. 
I struggled understanding how the positioning worked for certain parts and how they were affecting each other so I took a break and read some pages from the MDN documents 
to better understand how it works. I also used W3school as a site to look how to implement what I wanted. I want to the 100% done the home page by Saturday. I will work more
on it.

14/5
I finished the CSS for the homepage and started working on the CPU page. I finished both the html and css part of it. One issue that I found was the image wasn't a high enough resolution
to look nice so I ended up replacing it for another image. I constantly referenced W3school and MDN to refresh myself on certain parts and understand better how I wanted to implement features.
I plan to finish a page a day so I'll be able to submit on time.

15/5
I did a marathon of writing html and css and have roughly finished. I went page by page and used similar layouts to reduce the time needed but still added different things to the individal pages.
One stumbling block I found was the images upscaling and being pixely so I put them through a AI image upscaler as I still wanted to use the same image.
There wasn't many stumbling blocks but finding the time to sit down and work on it for a few hours at a time was hard to do. I also ended up referring to MDN a lot of the time and that was very useful for the project.
Onwards I'll go through the project and make sure everything is there and all the marks are ticked.

18/5
I have checked over all the project and made sure that everything was working correctly and all my images and stylesheets were where they 
needed to be. I also made sure to have the author block on every file and the appropriate information along with it. Another thing I added
was markdown for all the individual elements. I checked that all my bibliography was correct and file naming. I used git hub as quality control through out the project and it worked well to keep up to date with all my changes and revisions.
